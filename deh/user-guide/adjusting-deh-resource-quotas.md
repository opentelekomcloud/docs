## What Are Quotas?<a name="section102291042164212"></a>

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the cloud platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the quantity and capacity of resources available to users, for example, the number of DeHs and ECSs you can create.

You can also request more quotas if the existing resource quotas cannot meet your service requirements.

3.  On the  **Service Quota**  page, you can view the used quota and total quota of each DeH type.
