## What Is a Quota?<a name="en-us_topic_0118499026_section6321311611"></a>

A quota limits the quantity of a resource available to users, thereby preventing spikes in the usage of the resource. For example, a VPC quota limits the number of VPCs that can be created.

You can also request for an increase in quota if an existing quota cannot meet your service requirements.

The system does not support online quota adjustment. If you need to adjust a quota, call the hotline or send an email to the customer service mailbox. Customer service personnel will timely process your request for quota adjustment and inform you of the real-time progress by making a call or sending an email.

Before dialing the hotline number or sending an email, make sure that the following information has been obtained:

-   Domain name, project name, and project ID, which can be obtained by performing the following operations:

    Log in to the management console using the cloud account, click the username in the upper right corner, select  **My Credentials**  from the drop-down list, and obtain the domain name, project name, and project ID on the  **My Credentials**  page.

-   Quota information, which includes:
    -   Service name
    -   Quota type
    -   Required quota
