Tag management APIs are classified as the APIs for one-dimensional \(1D\) tags and the APIs for two-dimensional \(2D\) tags.

-   A 1D tag contains a string. All APIs for 1D tags are native OpenStack APIs. For details, see section  [Tag Management](tag-management(openstack).md).
-   A 2D tag consists of a key and a value. All APIs for 2D tags are ECS APIs. For details, see this section.

>-   2D tags are recommended.
