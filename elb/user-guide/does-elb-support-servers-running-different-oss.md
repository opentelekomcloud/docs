# Does ELB Support Servers Running Different OSs?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0091131447"></a>

Yes.

ELB does not restrict OSs of backend servers as long as applications on these servers are the same and the data is consistent. However, it is recommended that you install the same OS on backend servers to simplify management.
