The advantages of DCS include:

-   Usability off the shelf

    You can create DCS instances with just a few clicks on the DCS console or by calling application programming interfaces \(APIs\). DCS responds to instance creation commands without requiring you to deal with complex underlying software and hardware.

-   Customizable specifications

    DCS instance specifications range from 2 GB to 512 GB, increasing the flexibility of DCS.

-   Reliability

    Data persistence, support for master/standby and Proxy Cluster modes, and automatic failover between cache nodes ensure data reliability and service availability.

-   Ease of maintenance

    You can create, restart, and delete DCS instances with just a few clicks on the DCS console. DCS continuously monitors and maintains DCS instances so that you can focus on application development. Service monitoring metrics include keys, the number of client connections, and processed commands. System monitoring metrics include memory, CPU, and network usage.
