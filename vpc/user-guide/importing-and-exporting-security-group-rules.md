# Importing and Exporting Security Group Rules<a name="vpc_SecurityGroup_0007"></a>

## Scenarios<a name="sb919f19c991141d79a2deb79cec11a15"></a>

If you want to quickly apply the rules of one security group to another, or if you want to modify multiple rules of the current security group at the same time, you can import or export existing rules.

Inbound and outbound security group rules are exported in Excel format.

>When modifying exported security group rules, you can only modify existing fields in the exported file based on the template and cannot add new fields or modify the field names. Otherwise, the exported file cannot be imported into the system.
