# Updating a Stack<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0076468630"></a>

If the existing stack cannot meet your service requirements, you can use the update function to modify the stack. The procedure for updating a stack is the same as that for creating a stack.

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click  ![](figures/q00355783-云计算开发部-公有云_iaas-image-541f928f-f9be-4dd9-89fb-50ccdfaeb744.png)  in the upper left corner to select the desired region and project.
3.  Under  **Management & Deployment**, click  **Resource Template Service**.
4.  In the stack list, locate the target stack and click  **Update**  in the  **Operation**  column.

    The process of updating a stack is displayed.

5.  Upload a template.

    You can modify the template content or upload a new template file to update the stack. Note that you can replace the template content with another template or upload a new template package to rebuild the stack.

6.  Configure parameters based on the template that you use.

7.  Confirm that stack configurations are correct and click  **Submit**.

    It takes some time to complete the update.

Go back to the stack list and check whether stack status changes to  **Update complete**. You can also view the updated template and resource information on the stack details page and the entire life cycle of the stack on the  **Events**  page.
