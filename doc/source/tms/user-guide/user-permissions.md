# User Permissions<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0141727076"></a>

The public cloud system provides two types of user permissions by default: user management and resource management.

-   User management refers to the management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-   Users with resource management permissions can manage the operations performed on cloud service resources.

TMS provides the TMS administrator permission. Users with this permission can create, modify, and delete predefined tags.

To use resource tags, you must have the corresponding permission on the cloud service. Otherwise, the tag operations on cloud resources may not take effect.

Contact the system administrator to assign the corresponding cloud service permissions to the user group to which you belong.

For details about TMS user permissions, see  [Permissions](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/permissions/index.html).
