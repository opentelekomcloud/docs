# Can My Database Be Used in the Backup Window?<a name="rds_faq_0044"></a>

A backup window is a user-specified time segment during which backup of RDS DB instances is performed. With these periodic data backups, the RDS allows you to restore RDS DB instances to the backups in the reservation period. This backup process does not affect services. However, you cannot reboot the database on the RDS console.
