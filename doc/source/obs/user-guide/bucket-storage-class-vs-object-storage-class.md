# Bucket Storage Class vs. Object Storage Class<a name="obs_faq_0132"></a>

When an object is uploaded, it inherits the storage class of the bucket by default. You can change the default storage class when you upload the object.

Changing the storage class of a bucket does not change the storage classes of existing objects in the bucket, but newly uploaded objects inherit the new storage class by default.
