DIS works with the following services:

-   Object Storage Service \(OBS\)

    If you set  **Dump Destination**  to OBS, the uploaded data will be stored to OBS.

-   Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)

    IAM provides user authentication for DIS.

-   Cloud Trace Service \(CTS\)

    CTS is used to record the operations you have performed on DIS for later querying, auditing, or backtracking. For details, see the  _Cloud Trace Service User Guide_.
