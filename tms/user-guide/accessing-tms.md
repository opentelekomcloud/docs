# Accessing TMS<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0141727115"></a>

The public cloud provides a web-based service management platform. You can access TMS through the management console or HTTPS-compliant application programming interfaces \(APIs\). These two access modes differ as follows:

-   Using APIs

    If you need to integrate TMS on the public cloud into a third-party system for secondary development, use APIs to access TMS. For details, see the Tag Management Service API Reference.

-   Through the management console

    The management console is a web user interface for you to manage your compute, storage, and other cloud resources. Tenants and users who have registered on the cloud platform can access TMS by selecting  **Tag Management Service**  under  **Management & Deployment**  on the management console.
