# Will I Be Promptly Notified When an Attack Is Detected?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0204851461"></a>

You will be promptly notified when an attack is detected after you have enabled alarm notification.

On the Anti-DDoS console page, click the  **Alarm Notifications**  tab and enable the alarm notification function. Then you will receive notifications \(by SMS or email\) if a DDoS attack is detected.
