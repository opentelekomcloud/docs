A tag is a key-value pair customized by users and used to classify and search for cloud resources.

A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value.

-   A tag key can contain multiple tag values.
-   A cloud resource cannot have duplicate tag keys.

On DWS, only cluster resources support the tag function.
