An account ID is required for some URLs when an API is called. To obtain the account ID, perform the following steps:

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click the username and select  **My Credential**  from the drop-down list.

    On the  **My Credentials**  page, view the  **Account ID**. For example,  **3c5ea483e62a490b979c9ab8813debb3**.
