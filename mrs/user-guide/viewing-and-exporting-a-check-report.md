>A system health check includes  MRS Manager, service-level, and host-level health checks:  
>-   MRS Manager health checks focus on whether the unified management platform can provide management functions.  
>-   Service-level health checks focus on whether components can provide services properly.  
>-   Host-level health checks focus on whether host indicators are normal.  
>The system health check has three types of check items: Health Status, related alarms, and customized monitoring indicators  for each check object. The health check results are not always the same as the **Health Status** on the portal.
