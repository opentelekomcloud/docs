# User Permissions<a name="en-us_topic_0054095658"></a>

RDS provides two types of user permissions by default:  user management  and  resource management.

-   User management permissions cover the management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-   Resource management permissions cover the management of controlling operations on cloud service resources.

User management allows you to create, delete, and modify users, and allows you to grant permissions to users. Resource management refers to the management of operation permissions such as creating, deleting, modifying, and setting cloud resources. After resources and users are added to a user group, the users can inherit permissions assigned to their user group. User permissions management based on user groups is more organized and helps avoid confusions.
