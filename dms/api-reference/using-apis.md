# Using APIs<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0235791097"></a>

Public cloud application programming interfaces \(APIs\) comply with the RESTful API design principles. REST-based web services are organized into resources. Each resource is identified by one or more Uniform Resource Identifiers \(URIs\). An application accesses a resource based on the resource's Unified Resource Locator \(URL\). A URL is usually in the following format:  **https://_Endpoint_/_uri_**. In the URL,  **_uri_**_ _indicates the resource path, that is, the API access path.

Public cloud APIs use HTTPS as the transmission protocol. Requests/Responses are transmitted by using JSON messages, with media type represented by  **Application/json**.

For details about how to use APIs, see  [API Usage Guidelines](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/apiug/apig-en-api-180328001.html?tag=API%20Documents).
