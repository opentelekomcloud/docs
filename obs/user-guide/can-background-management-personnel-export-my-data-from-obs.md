# Can Background Management Personnel Export My Data from OBS?<a name="obs_faq_0040"></a>

Administrators cannot export user data. For example, if a bucket or an object is undisclosed when you access the bucket or object, only the owner of the bucket or object can access it. Further, the access to the bucket or object requires access keys \(AK/SK\).
