# An Object Fails to Be Downloaded Using Internet Explorer 11<a name="obs_03_0343"></a>

## Question<a name="section46070597"></a>

A user logs in to OBS Console using Internet Explorer 11 and uploads an object. When the user attempts to download the object to the original path to replace the original object without closing the browser, a message is displayed indicating a download failure. Why does this happen?

For example, a user uploads object  **abc**  from the root directory of local drive C to a bucket in OBS Console. When the user attempts to download the object to the root directory of local drive C to replace the original object without closing the browser, a message is displayed indicating a download failure.

This problem is caused by browser incompatibility. It can be solved by using a different web browser.

If this problem occurs, close the browser and try again.
