# Application Scenarios<a name="obs_03_0202"></a>

-   OBS can be used to access and store massive objects of all formats. As a web service, storage and access operations can be performed on OBS anytime at any location over the Internet. For all Internet-based application programs such as websites, video applications, Software as a Service \(SaaS\) applications, web disks, and mobile apps, developers can use OBS as the ideal choice to store data of these applications. In addition, OBS reduces costs in the following scenarios: backup, big data storage, and archiving.
-   OBS features unlimited scalability \(large capacity, linear expansion, and 5 TB single file storage\), cost effectiveness \(zero initial investment, more cost-effective as the used capacity increases\), robust reliability, and enhanced security \(end-to-end security for access, transfer, and storage\). With OBS, developers can focus on service innovations instead of underlying storage technologies. Developers do not need to plan storage capacity as services grow. Data can be quickly accessed and capacity is highly scalable. Robust reliability and enhanced security are available. Most importantly, IT costs can be reduced significantly.

OBS can be used in video surveillance, video on demand \(VOD\), backup and archiving, HPC, mobile Internet, and enterprise cloud box \(web disk\) scenarios.
