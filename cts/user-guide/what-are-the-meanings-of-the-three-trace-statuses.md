# What Are the Meanings of the Three Trace Statuses?<a name="cts_faq_020"></a>

The trace status is defined based on  **trace\_status**  information recorded in a trace. Different fields have different meanings as follows:

-   **normal**: indicates that this operation succeeded.
-   **warning**: indicates that this operation failed.
-   **incident**: indicates that this operation causes a more serious consequence than a failure, for example, causing a node failure or service interruption.
