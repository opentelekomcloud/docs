-   You can view the slow query logs to check whether any slowly executed SQL queries exist and view the performance characteristics of queries \(if any\) to locate the cause of slow queries.

    For details on DDS log queries, see section  [Slow Query Log](slow-query-log.md).


-   You can also view CPU usage metrics of DDS DB instances to facilitate problem locating. For details, see section  [Viewing DDS Metrics](viewing-dds-metrics.md).
