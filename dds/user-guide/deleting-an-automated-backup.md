## **Scenarios**<a name="section28937012194642"></a>

This section guides you on how to delete an automated backup. If the automated backup policy is disabled, DDS allows you to delete stored automated backups to release storage space.

If the automated backup policy is enabled, DDS will delete automated backups as they expire. You cannot delete them manually.
