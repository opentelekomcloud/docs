# Collecting Standard Output Logs of Containers<a name="cce_01_0110"></a>

CCE allows you to configure policies for collecting, managing, and analyzing workload logs periodically to prevent logs from being over-sized.

This section describes how to collect standard output logs of containers. If you want to configure a log policy to collect container logs from specified paths, see  [Collecting Container Logs from Specified Paths](collecting-container-logs-from-specified-paths.md).

1.  When creating a  workload, add a  container. Then, expand  **Log Policies**.
2.  Retain the default configurations. Create your workload \(Nginx as an example\).
3.  View logs.

    After the workload is created, access Nginx. Go to the workload details page and click the  **Logs**  button in the upper right corner to view the log details. Wait for about 5 minutes to view logs.
